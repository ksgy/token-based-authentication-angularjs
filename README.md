token-based-authentication-angularjs
====================================


How to install:

After cloning the repository run inside the app folder

>> npm install

>> bower install

Run the app

>> grunt serve

After that you should be able to test the authentication along with the API

You must have both projets(API and Front-end) running in the same time. They will run as localhost, but in diff ports.
